The integration of gesture recognition technology into assistive devices has marked a significant advancement in the field of human-computer interaction, particularly for individuals with mobility impairments. Traditional input methods, such as joystick controls, may present challenges for users with limited hand dexterity or motor control. Hence, there arises a pressing need to explore alternative interfaces that offer greater accessibility, ease of use, and intuitive interaction. The Hand GestureControlled Wheelchair project is motivated by this need, aiming to harness the power of gesture recognition technology to revolutionize wheelchair navigation and empower individuals with severe physical disabilities.
